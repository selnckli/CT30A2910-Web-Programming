## üå¶Ô∏è Final Project: Weather App

### Description

My final project is a responsive Weather App built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).  
The app lets users:

- **Search weather** by city name or use their **current location** (via the Geolocation API)
- See the **current weather** at their chosen location
- View a **7-day forecast**
- View a **24-hour hourly forecast** (displayed as a modern horizontal card layout)
- **Switch temperature units** between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin (all numbers update instantly)
- **Tag and access favorite locations** from a favorites bar
- Enjoy a UI that reflects the current weather visually (background color changes for hot, cold, warm)
- Use the app easily on desktop and mobile (fully responsive design)

The app uses [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) as its data source.  
All features were implemented with a focus on clarity, usability, and a modern, user-friendly look.
